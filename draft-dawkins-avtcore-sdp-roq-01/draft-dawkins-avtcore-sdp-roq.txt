                SDP Offer/Answer for RTP over QUIC (RoQ)
                  draft-dawkins-avtcore-sdp-roq-latest

Abstract

   This document is intended to allow the use of QUIC as an underlying
   transport protocol for RTP applications that commonly use SDP as a
   session signaling protocol to set up RTP connections, such as SIP and
   WebRTC.  The document describes several new SDP "proto" and
   "attribute-name" attribute values in the "Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) Parameters" IANA registry that can be used to describe
   QUIC transport for RTP and RTCP packets, and describes how SDP Offer/
   Answer can be used to set up an RTP connection using QUIC.

   This document also contains non-normative guidance for implementers.

1.  Introduction

   This document is intended to allow the use of QUIC as an underlying
   transport protocol for RTP applications that commonly use SDP as a
   session signaling protocol to set up RTP connections, such as SIP
   ([RFC3261]) and WebRTC ([RFC8825]).  The document describes several
   new SDP "proto" and "attribute-name" attribute values in the "Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" IANA registry ([SDP-protos]
   and [SDP-attribute-name]) that can be used to describe QUIC transport
   for RTP and RTCP packets (hereafter abbreviated as "RoQ"), and
   describes how SDP Offer/Answer ([RFC3264]) can be used to set up an
   RTP ([RFC3550]) connection using QUIC ([RFC9000] and related
   specifications), as defined in [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].

   The normative descriptions and requirements for RoQ SDP appear in
   Section 3, Section 4, and Section 5.

   Non-normative guidance for implementers appears in Section 6.

   A sample SDP offer appears in Section 7.

1.1.  Notes for Readers

   (Note to RFC Editor - if this document ever reaches you, please
   remove this section)

   This document has not yet been adopted by any IETF working group, so
   does not carry any special status within the IETF.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Because the use of SDP to describe RTP over QUIC transport relies
   heavily on terminology introduced in
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic], the definitions in that document
   are prerequisite for understanding this document, and those terms are
   included here by reference.

3.  New SDP Protocol identifiers

   This document reuses AVP profiles from [SDP-protos], in order to
   allow existing SIP and RTCWEB RTP applications to migrate more easily
   to RTP over QUIC.

3.1.  The QUIC proto

   The 'QUIC' protocol identifier is similar to the 'UDP' and 'TCP'
   protocol identifiers in that it only describes the transport
   protocol, and not the upper-layer protocol.

   An 'm' line that specifies 'QUIC' MUST further qualify the
   application-layer protocol using an fmt identifier, such as
   "QUIC/RTP/AVPF".

   Media described using an 'm' line containing the 'QUIC' protocol
   identifier are carried using QUIC streams, as defined in [RFC9000],
   or in QUIC DATAGRAMs, as defined in [RFC9221].

3.2.  RoQ RTP Protos

   As much as possible, attributes used in this section are reused from
   other specifications, with references to the original definitions.

3.2.1.  The QUIC/RTP/AVP proto

   The QUIC/RTP/AVP transport describes RTP media with minimal RTCP-
   based feedback ("RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with
   Minimal Control"), as defined in [RFC3551].

   The QUIC/RTP/AVP transport is realized using the framing method
   described in [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].

3.2.2.  The QUIC/RTP/AVPF proto

   The QUIC/RTP/AVPF transport describes RTP media with extended RTCP-
   based feedback RTP/AVPF ("Extended RTP Profile for Real-time
   Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF)"), as
   defined in [RFC4585].

   The QUIC/RTP/AVPF transport is realized using the framing method
   described in [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].

3.2.3.  The QUIC/RTP/SAVP proto

   The QUIC/RTP/SAVP transport describes RTP media with RTP/SAVP ("The
   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"), as defined in
   [RFC3711].

   The QUIC/RTP/SAVP transport is realized using the framing method
   described in [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].

3.2.4.  The QUIC/RTP/SAVPF proto

   The QUIC/RTP/SAVPF transport describes RTP media with RTP/SAVPF
   ("Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control
   Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF)"), as defined in
   [RFC5124].

   The QUIC/RTP/SAVPF transport is realized using the framing method
   described in [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].

3.3.  AV Profile-related Security Considerations

   This document currently defines the QUIC/RTP/SAVP and QUIC/RTP/SAVPF
   secure profiles, although this might seem unnecessary, because RoQ
   already uses QUIC security mechanisms.  That choice is made for two
   reasons:

   *  If an implementer wishes to adapt an existing RTP application to
      use RoQ, and that application uses a secure AVP profile (for
      example, SAVPF), providing support for legacy secure AVP profiles
      minimizes the changes required to the implementations at each end.

   *  While an RoQ RTP endpoint might wish to communicate with other RoQ
      RTP endpoints using an AVP profile that does not include media-
      level security (for example, AVPF) when communicating with a non-
      RoQ RTP endpoint, this communication must by definition use a
      Topo-PtP-Translator RTP middlebox (as described in Section 3.2.1
      of [RFC7667], and the RoQ endpoint has no way to know whether the
      RTP middlebox has negotiated a secure AVP profile with the non-RoQ
      endpoint.  In this situation, a RoQ implementation can use some
      approach like SFRAME, as described in [RFC9605], to achieve end-
      to-end media security, at the price of disallowing some types of
      translating middleboxes (for example, Topo-Media-Translator
      middleboxes, as described in Section 3.2.1.3 of [RFC7667]).

      *NOTE:* Any PtP Translator middlebox that negotiates an RTP/AVP(F)
      AVP profile to both RTP endpoints, rather than an RTP/SAVP(F)
      profile, introduces a security risk.  This is the case no matter
      which transport protocols are being translated, and the
      introduction of RoQ as an RTP transport protocol does nothing to
      change this risk.

4.  New SDP Attribute-Names for RoQ

   This section describes new SDP attributes that are created for use
   with RoQ.

4.1.  RoQ Flow Identifiers

   Section 5.1 of [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic] introduces a
   multiplexing identifier for RTP flows carried over a QUIC connection
   called "Flow Identifiers".  This section defines a new SDP media-
   level attribute, "roq-flow-id".  The attribute can be associated with
   an SDP media description ("m=" line) with any of the QUIC proto
   values defined in Section 3.1.  In that case, the "m=" line port
   value indicates the port of the underlying QUIC transport UDP port,
   and the "roq-flow-id" value indicates the RoQ Flow Identifier.

   No default value is defined for the SDP "roq-flow-id" attribute.
   Therefore, if the attribute is not present, the associated "m=" line
   MUST be considered invalid.

   The definition of the SDP "roq-flow-id" attribute is:

   Attribute name: roq-flow-id

   Type of attribute: session or media

   Mux category: CAUTION

      *NOTE:* This specification sets the mux category (as discussed in
      Section 4 of [RFC8859]) as CAUTION, as an RTP mixer which is
      multiplexing several incoming streams onto one connection needs to
      ensure that RoQ Flow Identifiers do not overlap, and might need to
      rewrite the Flow Identifiers in received streams when further
      multiplexing them.

   Subject to charset: No

   Purpose: This attribute indicates the RoQ Flow Idenfitier associated
   with the SDP media description.

   Contact e-mail: spencerdawkins.ietf@gmail.com

   Reference: [I-D.dawkins-avtcore-sdp-roq] (This document)

   Syntax:

       roq-flow-id = 1*19(DIGIT) ; DIGIT defined in RFC 4566

   The RoQ flow identifier range is between 0 and 4611686018427387903
   (2^62 - 1) (both included).  Leading zeroes MUST NOT be used.

5.  Special Considerations for Selected SDP Attributes When Using RoQ
    Transport

   This section does not introduce new SDP attribute extensions, but
   describes how some existing SDP attribute extensions are reused to
   describe RoQ media flows.

   We have two goals for this section:

   *  To describe how existing SDP attributes are used differently in
      order to support RoQ, and

   *  To be able to make the statement that other existing SDP attribute
      extensions can be reused with RoQ, with no special considerations.

   This document assumes that an authenticated QUIC connection will be
   opened using a "roq" ALPN or some other ALPN, as described in
   Section 4.1 of [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].

5.1.  The SDP "setup" Attribute

   The SDP "setup" attribute, defined for media over TCP in [RFC4145],
   is reused to indicate which endpoint initiates a QUIC connection
   (whether the endpoint actively opens a QUIC connection, or accepts an
   incoming QUIC connection.  This attribute MUST be present in SDP
   offers and answers for RoQ.

5.2.  The SDP "tls-id" Attribute

   The SDP "tls-id" attribute is reused as described in Section 5.1 of
   [RFC8842] to allow either endpoint to decide whether to open a new
   QUIC connection, rather than reusing an existing QUIC connection.
   This attribute MUST be present in SDP offers and answers for RoQ.

5.3.  The SDP "fingerprint" Attribute

   Because QUIC itself uses the TLS handshake as described in [RFC9001],
   the parties to a RoQ session MUST also provide authentication
   certificates as part of the TLS handshake procedure, as described in
   Section 5 of [RFC8122].  When self-signed certificates are used,
   certificate fingerprint is represented in SDP using the fingerprint
   SDP attribute, as illustrated in Section 3.4 of [RFC8122], in order
   to allow mutual authentication, and provide assurance that two
   endpoints with no prior relationship are not being subjected to a
   person-in-the-middle attack, unless the signaling channel is also
   subjected to a person-in-the-middle attack.

5.4.  The SDP "rtcp-mux" Attribute

   A RoQ application MUST include the "rtcp-mux" attribute defined in
   [RFC5761] in its SDP signaling.

6.  Implementation Topics

   *Note:* Section 6 contains no normative requirements.

   Section 3, Section 4, and Section 5 of this document provide
   normative requirements for RoQ endpoints that use SDP for signaling.

   Beyond those normative requirements, there are topics that are worth
   considering as part of implementation work, because we have been
   asked, "but what about the grommet SDP extension?"  These topics are
   not part of the normative "SDP for RoQ" specification, but are
   gathered here for now.  These topics might better appear in an
   appendix, a separate "SDP for RoQ Implementation Guide", or even best
   included in the GitHub repository Wiki for this document, because
   that would allow us to maintain this material on an ongoing basis.

6.1.  Bundling Considerations

   [RFC8843] describes a Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping
   Framework extension called 'BUNDLE'.  The extension can be used with
   the SDP offer/answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a single
   transport (5-tuple) for sending and receiving media described by
   multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" sections).

   The authors believe that no special considerations apply when using
   BUNDLE with a single QUIC connection carrying RoQ.

   If an application uses multiple 5-tuples in order to allow QUIC
   Connection Migration as described in Section 9 of [RFC9000], it is
   assumed that only one QUIC path will be active at any given time.

   If an application uses multiple 5-tuples in order to make use of the
   Multipath Extension for QUIC as described in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-multipath], this would allow multiple QUIC paths
   to be active simultaneously, and this assumption will need revisiting
   when [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-multipath] is approved.

6.2.  Implications of Replacing RTCP Feedback with QUIC Feedback

   Section 10.4 of [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic] describes how some
   RTCP feedback can be replaced by equivalent statistics that are
   already collected by QUIC.  The exact RTCP feedback that can be
   replaced depends on the QUIC statistics exposed by the underlying
   QUIC implementation, and these QUIC statistics might depend in turn
   on QUIC extensions supported in the underlying QUIC implementation.
   The set of possible relevant QUIC extensions is not fixed, but some
   discussion appears in Section 11 of [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].
   For these reasons, decisions about what RTCP feedback can be replaced
   will always be media-dependent and implementation-dependent.

   It is assumed that an implementer will review the application
   requirements, the RTP proto in use, the available RTCP feedback for
   the media types being transferred, and available QUIC statistics, and
   will do the right thing.

   More information about what RTCP feedback might be replaced by QUIC
   statistics, and what is possible, appears in Appendix B of
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic].

6.3.  Implications of Congestion Control

   A significant distinction between QUIC transport and UDP transport is
   that QUIC transport is always congestion-controlled at the QUIC
   layer.  For RTP media, this ought to be a distinction without a
   difference.  RoQ applications, like any other RTP applications, ought
   to perform flow control and congestion control using a control
   mechanism that is appropriate for the media being transferred.

   Having said this, it is worth saying that RoQ applications can use
   any RTCP mechanisms such as Codec Control Messages [RFC5104] that can
   affect variables such as the Maximum Media Stream Bit Rate, as long
   as the RTP application respects the relevant congestion control
   considerations (in the case of Codec Control Messages, these
   considerations appear in Section 5 of [RFC5104]).

   RoQ applications can also use bandwidth modifiers ("b="), as
   described in Section 6 of [RFC8859], to control bandwidth at the
   media level, as is the case with any other RTP applications.

   RoQ applications can also use RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Feedback
   for Congestion Control, as described in [RFC8888].

   Because RoQ applications are always congestion controlled at the QUIC
   connection level, QUIC congestion control also acts as an RTP Circuit
   Breaker [RFC8083], with no special considerations for RoQ.

6.4.  Implications of using ICE with RoQ

   The profiles defined in Section 3.2 assume that if an application
   needs to perform NAT traversal, the endpoints will perform ICE
   procedures as described in [RFC8445] to gather and prioritize
   candidate pairs, and will then select candidate pairs that can be
   included in SDP media lines, as described in Section 3.2.

   *Editors' Note:* Other ways of performing NAT traversal for QUIC are
   possible, and this specification might be modified to support one or
   more of those methods in the future, given sufficient requirements.
   The modifications would likely include additional protos being
   defined in Section 3.2.  The editors encourage feedback on this
   point.

   Because a peer address is validated during QUIC connection
   establishment as described in Section 8.1 of [RFC9000], when a RoQ
   endpoint uses ICE [RFC8445] to communicate with another RoQ endpoint,
   an ICE agent will have already performed ICE candidate pair
   connectivity checking before a QUIC connection can be opened for use
   with RoQ.

   An implementer should be aware that it is possible for a RoQ
   connection to be subject to "ping"/liveness checks at several
   different levels:

   *  QUIC PING frames, as described in Section 10.1.2 of [RFC9000]

   *  ICE keepalives, as described in Section 10 of [RFC5245] and in
      [RFC6263]

   *  ICE consent freshness, as described in [RFC7675]

   *  RTCP packets, as described in Section 6.2 of [RFC3550]

   The following considerations are worth reviewing for implementers.

   *  QUIC PING frames are entirely under the control of an
      implementation.  If a QUIC connection carries RTP/RTCP traffic,
      the RTCP transmission interval is likely to suffice for RTP
      liveness detection, but a wise implementer will look at this in
      their environment and proceed accordingly.

   *  ICE consent freshness, as described in Section 4 of [RFC7675],
      also serves the ICE keepalive function, so ICE keepalives are no
      longer necessary.

   *  At least some RTCP feedback might be unnecessary, as described in
      Section 6.2, so a wise implementer will look at what RTCP feedback
      can be replaced with QUIC feedback.

7.  A QUIC/RTP/AVPF Offer Example

   *Editor's Note:* Spencer has been updating this example while working
   on the document, but we will need to review it carefully, before
   requesting Working Group Last Call.

   *Note:* Section 7 contains no normative requirements.

   A complete example of an SDP offer using QUIC/RTP/AVPF might look
   like:
